# Spam SMS Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. The project leverages techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings, with classifiers like Logistic Regression, to accurately identify spam messages.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- SMS message data, labeled as either spam or legitimate (ham), is collected and imported into the Python environment.
- The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents, including summary statistics and class distributions.

### 2. Text Processing
- Textual data is preprocessed by tokenizing, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization.
- TF-IDF is used to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
- Alternatively, word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe may be used to represent the textual data.

### 3. Model Building
- A Logistic Regression model is built using the processed textual features.
- The model's parameters are tuned to optimize its performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation is performed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

### 5. Prediction
- The model is used to predict whether new, unseen SMS messages are spam or legitimate.
- Predictions are compared with actual labels to validate the model further.

### 6. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions based on the model's performance are summarized.
- Potential improvements and future work are discussed to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.

## Dataset

- **SMS Messages Dataset**: Contains SMS messages labeled as either spam or legitimate (ham), providing the textual information necessary for training and evaluation.
